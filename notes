Add all progress to this. Keep track by days.

TODO:
	=> Create sunburst from interaction.
	-> Aggregate edges.
	-> Clean up code.

> Update sunburst from panel (including no sunburst)
> Print and submit Camilla forms.
> Start aggregating edges.

- Keqin emailed me Box-Cox paper. 
- Adjusts nodes by variance within ring buffer. 
- Commented Sunburst function.
- Centered graph to avoid clipping.
6.17
- Swapped ancestor ring with child ring.
- Added radio panel for sunburst settings. 


Sunburst Slider:
The radius of every node displayed is proportional to a metric.

- Find each node's associated radius and variance.
	> TreeRing has member array _ring. This collection has two fields:
	> parallel arrays _node_variance and _radius. Both extend from i
	> to _ring[n]._node_num for n to _num_layers. CV uses _node_cv and
	> domain uses _node_domain.

	> Sample code:
	for (int layer = 0; layer < _num_layers; ++layer) {

		Ring &ring = _ring[layer];
		for (int i = 0; i < ring._node_num; i++) {

			double var = ring._node_variance[i];
			ring._radius[i] += var;
		}
	}

- Pick sunburst from GLUT radio panel.
	> User can pick No Sunburst or a metric. The sunburst pattern will
	> repoistion itself in TreeRing. Command needs to be sent from
	> main to CompoundGraph to TreeRing. Should emulate coloring
	> process.
	
	> Problem #1: Calling TreeRing::UpdateSunburst() every render
	> makes nodes unselectable.

Consistency:
	- Comment all classes, functions and logic.
	- Keep consistent spacing and naming conventions.
	- Fix spelling mistakes. (e.g. compoudgraph) 
	- Add gesture to get from bible to graph.
	- Certain patch of nodes doesn't highlight.
	- Edges only reposition if source moves.
